Game Cross Compiler
===================

This project is a website, (to be hosted at http://gamecc.org) which serves an
AJAX-style application, called the GameCC Editor. In addition to that, it also
provides a community hub for sharing created and in progress games.

The Editor is similar in design and insperation to the GameMaker project, which
I much admire. This project was created for a few reasons:

- GameMaker does not support Linux
- GameMaker executables are also windows-only
- There are many interface changes that I have envisioned, and as GameMaker is
  closed source, I can't just add them...so I made my own. In python =)

This project provides a cross-platform editor (as it is web-based, it will run
anywhere you can run firefox or chrome) which has the ability to compile to a
variety of platforms. Among these platforms are (finished and planned):

- python
- flash (via HaXe)
- android phone
- javascript canvas
- C++
- java

- ...maybe iPhone...but I don't really like iPhone. If someone comes along and
  wants to write a backend, be my guest.

This project is also open source (as Mark Overmars' is not) which given its
pluggable design can allow for much more rapid and community-basec development.
